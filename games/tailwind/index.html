<h3>Before you die, <strong>live</strong>.</h3>
    <p>
    You are the last survivor of an alien invasion that has all but destroyed your homeworld. Barely escaping the atmosphere in your experimental ship, the <em>Keravnós</em>, you realize you don’t have enough fuel to survive.<br/><br/>

You are going to die.<br/><br/>

F$#! it. If this is your time, you might as well spend it doing what you do best: aerial ballet. Rain from the heavens as a bolt of lightning in one final blaze of glory.
    </p>

    <h3>Sounds great! Where can I get it?</h3>
    <p>
    <em>Tailwind: Prologue</em> was released exclusively in the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/monthly/p/april_2016_monthly">Humble Monthly Bundle</a> as a Humble Original in April 2016.
    </p>

    <p>If you missed that bundle, you’re out of luck for now. </p>

    <p>But there is good news!</p>

    <p>We’re working on a larger version of the game, simply called <em>Tailwind</em>! We haven’t announced platforms or release date yet, but you can keep in the know by joining our <a href="/mailinglist">mailing list</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="story">The Story</h3>
    <p>
    Once upon a time, a small team of two decided they’d like to take on creating a game in one of the oldest video game genres: the space shooter. Questions came up: Why exactly are you fighting? Why did you ever lose the war when your side has such powerful ships? Where did that ammo come from?
    </p>

    <p>
    Fueled with the passion of blowing up worlds with the wake of a tiny spaceship, we set out to create <em>Tailwind: Prologue</em> exclusively for <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/monthly/p/april_2016_monthly">Humble Monthly</a> as a Humble Original.
    </p>

    <p>The whole process was daunting. We started with 1 little promo graphic. This graphic was our touchstone for the whole creation experience. We also wanted to create a story, unlike any Cipher Prime game to date.</p>

    <p>
    This was a process of self-growth and discovery, and we’re unbelievable happy and proud of the experience.
    </p>

    <h3 id="process">Behind the Process</h3>
    <p>
    Most bullet hell games are focused on tight, pixel-precise movements — finding safe areas on the screen and only deviating from them when absolutely necessary. In Tailwind, we wanted to focus on the beauty of movement, a philosophy we call “aerial ballet.”
    </p>

    <p>In Tailwind you are not the aggressor: the stage has been set against you. You must destroy by placing yourself in harms way. You don’t have unlimited ammo or some big gun, you’ve got guts and a nice piece of destructive wake.
    </p>

    <p>The ship design and movement is inspired by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzXfVgYCxWI">Itano Circus</a>, an animation flourish made famous in anime like Macross — fighter pilots dancing through the air, narrowly avoiding huge barrages of missiles.
    </p>

    <p>The <a href="//music.cipherprime.com/album/keravn-s">music</a> was inspired by epic poems that recall famous last stands throughout history. Specifically, the poem that had the most influence was Lord Macaulay’s “Horatius at the Bridge,” containing this stanza:</p>

<p><em>
    And how can man die better<br/>
    Than facing fearful odds<br/>
    For the ashes of his fathers<br/>
    And the temples of his gods?<br/>
</em>
    </p>

    <p>Visually, we took inspiration from the promotional art of our contemporary indie game designers. <a href="http://www.no-mans-sky.com">No Man’s Sky</a>, <a href="http://www.mirrormoongame.com">Mirror Moon</a>, and <a href="http://www.firewatchgame.com">Firewatch</a> all served as references to bring the classic Cipher Prime style to a new, lived-in world. We wanted to pay homage to the look of these games while bringing something new.
