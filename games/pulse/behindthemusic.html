				<h2>Behind the Music</h2>
				<p>Pulse's original eight core tracks were composed in-house by Dain Saint and Kerry Gilbert. Over the course of months following the release we added 6 additional tracks of our own. 7 tracks were also added from some amazing Local Philadelphia Musicians like George & Jonathan. We even have a track from the legendary composer behind the game Sword and Sworcery, Jim Guthrie.</p>

				<h3>Local Musicians and Indie Talent, forget Licensing Deals.</h3>
				<p>Let's be honest, music is the core of Pulse. It was really important to us that we had great music. Keeping our music local (Philadelphia) and indie gives Pulse a truly unique oral landscape. If you're a fan, be sure to checkout any of the generous artists who have contributed music to the game. You can find the <a href="#">soundtrack here.</a></p>

				<h3>Using Time Signatures to Enrich the Experience</h3>
				<p>By adapting the geography of a level to its song's time signature, we were able to create a unique rhythm experience. For example, let's say a particular song has a 4/4 time signature. We'll setup the level to have either 4 or 8 rings. What about a time signature like 3/4 - for example, a waltz? We'll use 6 rings. Each pulse then represents one to two full measures of that song. This allows a freedom of form rarely seen in rhythm games and really completes the experience. Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks?</p>
