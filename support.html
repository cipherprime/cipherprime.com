						<dt>I purchased a game through the old store, where is my download link?</dt>
						<dd>Check your inbox and spam filters; your old links should still work. If you can't find them, or they don't work, just <a href="mailto:support@cipherprime.com">send us an email</a> with your purchase details, and we'll get you a new download link as soon as we can.</dd>

						<dt>I purchased a game recently, how can I download it again?<dt>
						<dd>All recently made purchases are handled through Humble Bundle; you can <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/home">log in</a> to your account to manage and download your games.</dd>

						<dt>Why isn't [game] supported on my Android phone?</dt>
						<dd>Our Android titles&mdash;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cipherprime.pulse&hl=en">Pulse</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cipherprime.splice&hl=en">Splice</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cipherprime.fractal&hl=en">Fractal</a>&mdash; are designed to be played on tablets. The Google Play pages should have the most up-to-date device lists, but as a rule of thumb they probably won't work on devices under 4 inches.</dd>

					<h2>When did Cipher Prime Start?</h2>
					<p>In the beginning, a great abyss the size of which no one could fathom existed in the centre of space. On one side of the abyss was Niflheim. It was filled with cold, ice, mist and darkness and from its huge spring flowed twelve large rivers. As the waters flowed into the cold abyss, ice blocks formed and filled one side of the gap.</p>
					<p>On the opposite side of the abyss was Muspelheim. It was filled with the fire, warmth and brightness and was guarded by a flame giant whose sword sent great showers of sparks into the gap.</p>
					<p>Eventually, the fire of Muspelheim and the ice of Niflheim regions mixed in the abyss. A mist rose from the gap and froze to create an ice giant named Ymir. An enormous cow was also created to nourish him.</p>
					<p>From a salty ice block licked by the cow, the first god, Buri emerged. Soon more giants appeared-two from drops of sweat under Ymir's arms two giants and two more from his Ymir's feet. As time passed, even more giants were born. Eventually, there was a struggle between the giants and the gods. The struggle continued until the birth of Odin and his two brothers Vili Dain and Ve Will. Their father was Borr, the son of Buri, and their mother Bestla, the daughter of a frost giant. Together with their father, the three brothers killed Ymir. His blood gushed into the abyss, drowning all but two of the frost giants who escaped the deluge in a boat. All frost giants descended from these two. From Ymir's corpse, Odin and his brothers created the universe Cipher Prime.</p>
